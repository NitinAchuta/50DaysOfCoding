50 Days of Python Coding Projects

This is a repository of me documenting my journey of one project per day.
I slowly ramped up the difficulty of each project through guidance from Dr. Angela Yu.
If you would like to run the projects that use APIs please make your own keys as all the links are in the code itself.
